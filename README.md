### DESCRIPTION OF OUR PROJECT:
>Project Type : Android and IOS application

- Core idea behind **CLARSI** is to make an application that will scan the **NEWS AND NOTIFICATION** column of VJTI website for you **every 4 hours!**
- To make users satisfied, we decided to add other features as well, such as assignments and classrooms.**CLARSI** is a confluence of all these branches.
- **CLARSI** is programmed in the most pragmatic way possible, constantly improving the virtues.
- Ingenuous logic design and aesthetic virtues make **CLARSI** an utilitarian tool for VJTI students.
- **CLARSI** contains two main pages namely, **Announcement Page** and **Assignment Page**.
	- **Announcement Page** Contains all the announcements made by college on website. All the links are clickable and by single touch the **CLARSI** makes the corresponding PDF available to you.
	- **Assignment Page** consists of list of assignments assigned to the class you joined. CR can add assignments time to time. CR also has authority to make changes in the date of submission.

- **Classes** are important features of **CLARSI**
	- Classes are similar to **Google classroom**.
	- User can create, join and leave classroom.
	- You can view the list of students in your classroom.
	- Roll number of a classmate can be viewed by tapping on his or her name.

- **The interactive UI** and **Ease of navigation** in CLARSI never gets old!!
