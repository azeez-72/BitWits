### Description
>Project Type: Flutter application

- Clarsi (Class Representative Student Interaction) provides a platform tailored to the needs of students of VJTI. It provides a more convenient option for receiving push notifications for announcements rather than rummaging the college website. In addition to that, as the name suggests, an interface is provided to ease communication between a class representative (CR) and students in one place.
- **CLARSI** contains two main pages namely, **Announcement Page** and **Assignment Page**.
	- **Announcement Page** lists all the announcements made by college on  the website. All the links are clickable and by single touch the **CLARSI** makes the corresponding PDF available to you.
	- **Assignment Page** consists of list of assignments assigned to the class you joined that behaves as a TODO list for each user. Additionally,assignment file and description can be viewed on tapping the list. CR can add assignments time to time. Assignment submission dates can be changed by the CR.

- **Classes** are important features of **CLARSI**
	- User can create, join and leave classroom.
	- You can view the list of students in your classroom.
	- Roll number of a classmate can be viewed by tapping on his or her name.

- With the **interactive UI** and **Ease of navigation**, Clarsi is a utilitarian tool for students in managing college work. <br/>

```

In the terminal or bash, make sure that you are in the BitWits directory.

The directory would look similar to this.

```

>After running this command, you would have **Clarsi** app open on your emulator or real device.

### Usage
--------------
- Once the app is opened, You will see registration screen. Follow the instructions to create your account.  
- You are free to create a class or Join pre-existing class.
- If you are the CR of your class, go ahead and click on **Create Class** button. It will redirect you to new page, where you will be asked to Enter your roll number, your year and branch. Then click on Create and you just created a new classroom!

- To join a class, click on **Join class** button. THen enter your roll number and classroom code that you must have received from CR. Click on Join.

### Application
--------------

- Have you ever found yourself visiting the VJTI website every 15 minutes just to check for new announcement uploaded by college? Then peace out and leave all of the trouble for us. All the announcements are visible in the app. You will be notified once new announcement is made. You can view the announcement PDF with just one click.
- Finding it difficult to remember the pending assignments? **CLARSI** contains a dedicated page made with the best aesthetic choices that contains all the assignments assigned to your class. You can also tick the checkbox if you have completed the assignment. Also you need not worry about the due dates. They are displayed along with assignments.

### Future Scopes 
--------------

- We are planning to add a feature that allows CR to add announcements in their classroom.
- Notifications for new assignments and assignment submission dates will be added in future.
